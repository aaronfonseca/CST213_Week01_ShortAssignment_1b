##Objective:

Design a bean that accesses an external data source.

##Activity Directions:

Create an entity bean that reads the content of an external data source (i.e., a text file) and provides information about the data read. Create a text file of at least 100 words, which include at least 5 numbers, peppered throughout the file. Your entity bean will provide the following information about the file:

	1. The number of characters
	2. The number of words
	3. The sum of all numbers

Design the bean as an entity and session and explain which one is a more appropriate choice, and why. Upon making the choice, implement the bean. Create an application that uses the bean and displays the results. Note that this is a server based application.

##What to submit:

1. A document explaining the approach to design and implementation, including a detailed list of all classes, methods, variables, and beans (upload to LoudCloud).
2. All Java source code uploaded to your GitHub or Bitbucket account (as directed by the instructor).
3. Screenshots demonstrating successful execution (upload to LoudCloud).
4. Post the link to your repository on LoudCloud as part of the assignment submission (GitHub or Bitbucket).
